I recently completed an exciting project using SQL to analyze pizza sales data across four tables: Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, and Pizza Type.

 By writing SQL queries, I uncovered patterns in total revenue, popular pizza types, peak sales times, and customer preferences.

This project not only sharpened my SQL skills but also demonstrated how data can drive better business decisions.
